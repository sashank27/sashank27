âœ¨ I am a Computer Science Undergrad at IIIT Allahabad, India(class of 2020). I originally hail from Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India.  I am an advocate for building open-source projects. Sharing what I know and continue to learn about programming is the thing I love doing!

Besides coding, I am a self-taught Astrophysicist and I love gazing the night sky! 
When I am not coding, I (try to!) read a lot of books and listen to music of different genres ðŸ˜„
